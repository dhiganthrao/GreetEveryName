# HospitalBot

This is a bot created to provide hospital addresses in a pincode provided by the user.

This bot makes use of the Hospital Directory dataset provided by data.gov.in.

If general hospitals in your area are to be found, simply tweet tagging @HospBot and the particular pincode in which you want to find hospitals.

Another additional feature is the bot can provide hospitals which are also COVID-19 testing facilities. Simply enter the city you're searching in while tagging @HospBot and the bot will provide you with the details.

This bot works by using Twitter's unofficial API for Python, TweePy.

### EDIT:
HospBot's Twitter account has now been deactivated. If you want to use the code for HospBot, simply make a applet under your existing Twitter Account by following [these steps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0wWwglE1Vc)
