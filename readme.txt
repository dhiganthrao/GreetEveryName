This is a bot created to provide hospital addresses in a pincode provided by the user.

This bot makes use of the Hospital Directory dataset provided by data.gov.in.

If general hospitals in your area are to be found, simply tweet tagging @HospBot and the particular pincode in which you want to find hospitals.

Another additional feature is the bot can provide hospitals which are also COVID-19 testing facilities. Simply enter the city you're searching in while taggin @HospBot and the bot will provide you with the details.

This bot works by using Twitter's unofficial API for Python, TweePy.
